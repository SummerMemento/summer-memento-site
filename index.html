Only about 200 students will get the chance to go, carefully chosen from the pool of all graduating students, making it one of the most sought-after camps in the Spruce League.</p>
                            <p class="para-text">The 23-day camp is located overseas on a small island off the coast of Chong-Yol, featuring various activities from kayaking to jamming, trekking to board games, and ending with the Grand Graduation Bash. The camp will be one of the most memorable experiences for these students, celebrating their time in school before they go off on their separate ways into the working world.</p>
                            <p class="para-text">Being one of the students chosen to go on this camp, you're both excited and nervous. Understandably so, because you don't know anyone who's going there. Still, you're open to the possibility of meeting new friends there.</p>

We really want to make this project special with more complex characters, a greater variety of choices, and a non-linear mechanic. It's definitely quite a task ahead and we're honestly excited to work on it. More details will be released as we begin to flesh out the project through storylines and prototypes, so stay tuned for updates.</p>

                        <p class="title-text">FAQ</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">Will you be making money off the game through sales or other means?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">We cannot confirm it at this juncture. We intend to raise money to fund this project through Patreon support, soundtrack sales, and direct donations. Should it not be enough, we might have to initially charge money for the game. We do not expect to profit from Summer Memento. All funds will be put towards the development of the game.</p>
                        <p class="para-text">Please understand that we are incurring a substantial amount of expenses, from maintaining a website to hiring an artist to design the graphics for the game. After all, we believe that artists should be compensated for their work. To this end we're already paying out of our own pockets. In addition, we are also pouring hundreds of hours into this project, from crafting this story to coding it out, from testing the game to promoting it to the public.</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: Maybe.</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">What do I have to do if I get selected?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">We are not expecting you to put in any work on your part, other than discussing your character's personality in detail should we choose your character. You're not obligated to contribute to development or pay anything. Everything will be handled by us. Think of it as a YCH where you'll be getting free art, free story, and being included in a dating simulator game!</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: Sit back and relax!</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">Will I get a cut of the profits if my character is included in the game?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">Likely no. As stated, we do not expect you to put in any work other than providing your character details, so you won't be compensated. However, you will get character art, a story, and publicity, all free of charge!</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: No.</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">Will you be including side characters in the game? If so, may I be included?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">Yeap. We have campers and camp staff team characters that we hope to open slots for. Stay tuned for more updates from us!</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: Stay tuned for updates!</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">Will you be including an option for a female main character or female love-interests?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">Unfortunately as of now we do not have the time, energy, and money to develop the storyline beyond too many characters. As such we are restricting it to only six characters looking for a gay relationship. In the long term, if this project is a success and we choose to develop another game, we might move in that direction, who knows?</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: No.</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">Will it matter if my character is a top of bottom?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">No. We're looking for characters whose personalities can complement each other. The story will be driven by character interactions, conflict, and resolution, so we want to select characters based on their individual personalities rather than their sexual preferences.</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: No.</p>
                        <p class="faq-text">Are you looking for artists for the project?</p>
                        <p class="para-text">Yes! Once we've finalized the storyline we can pin down the amount of artwork and commitment level required for the project. Until then, we can't provide the exact numbers. However, if you're interested or know of anyone who might be, send us a message at <a class="ref" href="https://twitter.com/SummerMemento">https://twitter.com/SummerMemento</a> and we'll answer any questions you may have.</p>
                        <p class="tldr-text">TLDR: Yes!</p>
